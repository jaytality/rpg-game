# RPG Game

This project is a browser based game heavily inspired by the lore of [DanMachi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is_It_Wrong_to_Try_to_Pick_Up_Girls_in_a_Dungeon%3F). Players who participate in "the game of the Gods" must push their "Clan" to gain the most glory possible for their Gods; through conquest of Dungeons, wealth through any means, exciting advanced research or sheer size of the Familia.
